Created as a project to learn more about pathfinding algorithms, as well as test their workings and performance.  
The program features a 2D map with GUI where diferent types of terrain can be created and then explored using the pathfinding algorithms implemented:  
-BFS  
-DFS  
-Dijkstra  
-Astar
